DungeonCrawler
==============

A simple rogue-like game written in Python.

Uses the libtcodpy library.

Currently, the game consists of a random map generator, and not much else. Maps can consist of up to 30 rooms,
all connected by horizontal and vertical tunnels.

Content is slowly being added, so please realize this is a work in progress.

Running the code
----------------

To run DungeonCrawler, you first need to make sure you have Python 2.7.3 installed. This currently will not
work with Python 3.

Download the code somewhere, unzip/tar it, cd into the directory and run

```
python DungeonCrawler.py
```

LAlt + Enter = Fullscreen mode
Escape = Exit
LAlt + LShift = Regenerate current map
